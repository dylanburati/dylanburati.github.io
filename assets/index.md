    title: About me
    content: |
      I am a sophomore at Northeastern University majoring in Electrical and Computer
      Engineering. My background knowledge comes from developing applications in Java
      (Android and standalone), but my goal is to gain expertise in both software and
      hardware.

      In 2017, I began listening to a lot more music, and I relearned to play the
      piano. Soon after, I taught myself basic music production, and eventually
      released an album of piano pieces on Bandcamp. I am also an avid skier and
      enjoy taking pictures like the one in the header.
